# Howto

This tool provides the answer to the question "How do I [build/install/release]?" within a software project.

Just checked out some repo? `how` lists available actions, such as how to build it, install it, test it, etc.

```bash
# what happens if you run howto on this repo 
$ git clone https://github.com/gschueler/howto
$ cd howto
$ how
```
